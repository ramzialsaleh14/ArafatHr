# Arafat HR (Expo React Native)

Basic Expo React Native scaffold with a simple login screen.

Getting started:

1. Install dependencies: npm install
2. Start the dev server: npm start
3. Use Expo Go (mobile) or an emulator to run the app.

Notes: This is a minimal starter. No backend is configured; login is client-side only.
